# Text-to-SQL Generator

In this project, I fine-tuned an open-source LLaMA 3 model *(Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct*) to translate natural language queries into SQL statements using the *gretelai/synthetic_text_to_sql* dataset. The model is deployed with a simple Gradio UI, accessible via Hugging Face Spaces.

## üõ†Ô∏è How it works

1. **Dataset**: gretelai/synthetic_text_to_sql ‚Äì synthetic text-SQL pairs.
2. **Model**: Fine-tuned Meta's LLaMA 3 using Hugging Face Transformers.
3. **Training**: Done in Google Colab + A100 (notebook provided).
4. **Interface**: Gradio-powered UI for real-time user input and SQL generation.
5. **Deployment**: Hosted on Hugging Face Spaces for public use.

## Challenges & Limitations
While building this project, I ran into a few technical challenges, some of them were regarding : Model Compatibility

I used the Unsloth library to fine-tune LLaMA 3 efficiently in Colab. However, the model trained with Unsloth includes some custom optimizations that made it incompatible with direct loading and inference on Hugging Face Spaces, which expects models in standard formats.

Therefore and to ensure compatibility with Hugging Face deployment, I used bitsandbytes (4-bit quantization) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning instead. This allowed the model to be saved and loaded with transformers for inference in the demo app.
